# Contributing to Kami Pricing Web Scraping Microservice

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Kami Pricing Web Scraping Microservice project. It's people like you that make it a great tool for everyone. We welcome contributions of all kinds from anyone.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## What we are looking for

We love contributions in several forms, including but not limited to:

- Bug reports
- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Feature requests
- Feature implementations
- Test improvements

## Ground Rules

- Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
- Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist: [Code Review Checklist](#code-review-checklist).
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

## Getting started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the details of an issue.

### Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to the Kami Pricing Web Scraping Microservice? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://link-to-your-repo/issues?q=label%3Abeginner) - issues that should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://link-to-your-repo/issues?q=label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues that should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Getting started with a Pull Request

Here's a quick guide to doing a great PR:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Code Review Checklist

This checklist helps ensure that code contributions meet the project's standards:

- The code is well-organized within the project's structure.
- Variables, methods, functions, and classes are clearly descriptive of their functionality.
- Any changes to the project setup or environment are documented in the README or wiki.
- The code runs without errors.
- PRs are small and include committed tests (if applicable).

## Reporting bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://link-to-your-repo/issues/new); it's that easy!

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

You can check your Python code against these styling guidelines:

- [PEP 8](https://pep.python.org/pep-0008/)
- Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- Use `black` for formatting Python code and `isort` for organizing imports.
